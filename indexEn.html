<h1> What is it?</h1>
<p>"Algotica" - is an educational game and it's aim is to teach people about algorithms and programming principles.
If you think that it is just a boring educational program for little kids than you are wrong. Those who have a big gaming expirience(and those who like game like, Portal,Limbo,Transistor and etc.) will find this game interesting,
because it is not a classical educational product. It has a deep story, uncommon gameplay and style, athmosperic music and a lot of interesting stuff that I trying to make with love from heart. Sadly but I am the only developer, artist, 3-d modeler and a composer of this game.
Moreover, this game is my thesis project in univesity. My main aim is to create an educational !GAME!,but not just a collection of tests with elements of gamification.<br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6QgBeKZVW5KMjRQYWlpWC0xSWs"> Download the game </a>. No installation is required. Just unpack it and launch "Algotica.exe".</p>
<h1> Want to learn more?</h1>

<p> I don't have a standalone blog for developing process of the game. All news you can find from my twitter and instagram account(links above).
On this page I will be updating how many percents of the game have been made to this very moment.</p>
<h1>Game completed:15%</h1>
<p> Yep, if you want to support this game you can send me money on this e-wallet <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/to/410013167973721">link on Yandex wallet</a>. If you are going to send me money, please, write down you name or nickname, so I will be able to mention you in credits or something like that. Thank you!</p>
